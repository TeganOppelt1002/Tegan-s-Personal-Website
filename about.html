        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>
            During my time at the University of Michigan, I pursued my passion for film through a comprehensive program
            that included film history, production, and screenwriting. Through coursework and practical experiences, I
            gained a thorough understanding of the technical and creative aspects of filmmaking. This involved writing
            multiple short scripts, producing and directing several short films, and carrying out complex
            post-production tasks like video editing, sound design, and special effects. My experience at the university
            helped me refine my storytelling skills and develop my technical expertise, positioning me as a well-rounded
            and adaptable filmmaker. Additionally, I obtained a sub-major in screenwriting.
